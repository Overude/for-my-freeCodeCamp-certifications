            <p id="quote">“<em><strong>Kiki Camarena</strong>’s memory is an inspiration to the nation. 
                Kiki gave his life <strong>20</strong> years ago to protect Americans from drug traffickers and keep us safer. 
                <strong>Every October</strong> children across America pay tribute to Kiki as they proudly wear Red Ribbons. 
                Please join me in wearing a <strong>Red Ribbon</strong> to pay homage not only to Special Agent Camarena, 
                but to all men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in support of our nation’s struggle 
                against drug trafficking and abuse,”</em></p>
